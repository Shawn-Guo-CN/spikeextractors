# SpikeExtractors

SpikeExtractors is a package of the SpikeInterface project that was designed to extract and convert between several file
formats for electrophysiology, and to handle probe information.

## Getting Started

To get started with SpikeExtractors, you can install it with pip:

```shell
pip install spikewidgets
```

You can also get SpikeExtractors through the [spikeinterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface) package:

```shell
pip install spikeinterface
```

You can also install SpikeExtractors locally by cloning the repo into your code base. If you install SpikeExtractors locally, you need to run the setup.py file.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikewidgets.git

cd spikewidgets
python setup.py install
```
